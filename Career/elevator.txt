I studied Mathematics and CS in undergraduate to develop the tools necessary to become a full stack data engineer.

To prove that, I worked with a course review website that analyzed grades and written reviews to help students select courses

After working for a year as a systems software engineer, I decided to redirect my career back to my love of data focused engineering.

I'm graduating in May fromU UVa's Data Science program, focusing in designing software driven data solutions.
