1) Dictionary
2) For each of the words, count has a value of 1
3) No count does not change, it's one for each value essentially
4) Word is the key. And word2count[word], returns the value
5) It could be the case that word2count does not yet contain the key 'word'
>>> words = {}
>>> words['word']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'word'
>>> words['words'] = 1
>>> words['words']
1
>>> words['words'] = words['words'] +1
>>> words['words']
2

6) If the word is already contain in the dictionary, it adds one to the current value and reassigns it
        if the word is not contained, it catches the error and initializes the new entry with 1

7) So if it isn't passed a file or is passed an empty file, it fails and won't run.
        if the try/catch for casting count as an int fails, then it will continue every time
