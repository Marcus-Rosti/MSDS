Goals:
    Better identify risky communications within the UVa network
    Provide realtime network analysis
    Develop a dynamic system of detection to mitigate changing attack patterns

Metrics:
    Compare volume of communications to identify risky behavior
    Measure spikes or changes in volatility 
    Identify known sources of malicious agents 

Hypothesis:
    Risky communications occur during both volatile and non volatile times
    There is no correlation to packet size and risky communcations
    There is no connection between IP networks and hostile agents
    Hostile agents target specific university IPs
