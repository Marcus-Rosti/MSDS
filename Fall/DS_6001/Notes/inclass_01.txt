Goals:
    Better identify risky communications within the UVa network
    Provide realtime network analysis
    Develop a dynamic system of detection to mitigate changing attack patterns
    Catagorize systems into high risk systems and highly vulnerable systems

Metrics:
    Compare volume of communications to identify risky behavior
    Measure spikes or changes in volatility 
    Correctly characterize risky agents within the UVa network
    Based on historical data, how many vulnerabilities/leaks can we predict
    How many vulnerable systems are leaking data at any one time

Hypothesis:
    There is no correlation to packet size and risky communcations
    There is no connection between IP networks and hostile agents
    Hostile agents target specific university IPs
    Preempting vulnerabilities is impossible
    More data is exposed via negligent users than hostile attackers
